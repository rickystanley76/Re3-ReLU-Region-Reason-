## Installation

### Step 1: Install UV (Recommended)

**UV** is a fast Python package installer. First, install UV:

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Alternative: Using pip (if UV installation fails):**
```bash
pip install uv
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

After installing UV, install the project dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirments.txt
```

**Note:** If you prefer using traditional pip, you can still use:
```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Quick Start

### Training Models

Use the interactive training script to create models for different datasets:

```bash
python quick_start.py
```

This script supports:
- **Iris Dataset** → `trained_iris_model_full.pth`
- **Accelerometer/Gyro Dataset** → `trained_accelerometer_model_full.pth`
- **Diabetes Dataset** → `trained_diabetes_model_full.pth`
- **Train All** → Train models for all datasets at once

The script will:
- Automatically configure appropriate model architectures for each dataset
- Train models with optimized hyperparameters
- Save both state dict and full model files
- Display test accuracy for each trained model

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Load a Model

You have three options:

1. **Upload Model File**: Upload a saved PyTorch model (.pth, .pt, or .pkl file)
   - Supports full models (saved with `torch.save(model, ...)`)
   - Supports state dicts (saved with `torch.save(model.state_dict(), ...)`)
   - Automatically handles PyTorch 2.6+ security requirements
   
2. **Create New Model**: Configure and create a new model with custom architecture
   - Specify input size, hidden layer sizes, and output size
   - Supports 1-3 hidden layers
   - Can load state dicts if previously uploaded

3. **Use Pre-trained**: Use models trained with `quick_start.py`

**Note**: The app automatically extracts model parameters and validates compatibility.

### Step 2: Load a Dataset

You have two options:

1. **Upload Dataset**: Upload your own CSV or TXT file
   - For CSV files: Select the target column from a dropdown
   - For TXT files: Automatically handles tab or space-separated format
   - **Automatic Feature Cleaning**: Non-numeric columns (like timestamps, IDs) are automatically excluded
   - The app will inform you which columns were dropped

2. **Use Built-in**: Choose from:
   - **Iris**: 4 features, 3 classes (classification)
   - **Seeds**: 7 features, 3 classes (classification)
   - **Spambase**: 57 features, 2 classes (binary classification)

## Tips

- **For best results**: Train your model first using `quick_start.py` or Jupyter notebooks, then load the trained model
- **Large datasets**: The region analysis may take time for large datasets (e.g., Diabetes with 253K+ samples). Consider using a subset for faster analysis
- **Model compatibility**: The app works best with Sequential PyTorch models with Linear and ReLU layers
- **Feature selection**: Non-numeric columns are automatically excluded - check the info message to see which columns were dropped
- **Class indices**: The app automatically handles sparse class indices and ensures proper indexing

## Troubleshooting

### Model not loading
- Ensure your model file is a valid PyTorch model (.pth, .pt, or .pkl)
- Check that the model architecture matches the expected format (Sequential with Linear and ReLU layers)
- For PyTorch 2.6+, the app automatically handles `weights_only=False` for full model loading
- If loading state dict, create the model architecture first, then the state dict will be applied

### Dataset loading errors
- For CSV files: Ensure the target column is clearly identified and contains valid labels
- For TXT files: The app tries whitespace-separated first, then tab-separated
- Non-numeric columns are automatically excluded - this is expected behavior
- Ensure all feature columns are numeric (or will be automatically dropped)
- Check that the target column has valid class labels

### IndexError or TypeError
- These errors have been fixed in recent updates
- Ensure you're using the latest version of the app
- If issues persist, check that class indices match the number of output classes

### Visualization issues
- If plots don't display, try refreshing the page
- Ensure matplotlib backend is properly configured
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Performance issues
- Large datasets (100K+ samples) may take time for region analysis
- Consider using a subset of data for faster exploration
- Single sample analysis is always fast regardless of dataset size
